Everybody should be afraid of the dark, and my father is just more aware about this than the rest of us. It is not that he had any trauma, he knows that darkness can hide dangers, and he wants to avoid them.

He's not a coward, he is a visionary, a risk avoiding one! Why face problems when you can avoid them ?! This is why my father choses to be afraid of the dark.

You should be to, it's the right thing.
