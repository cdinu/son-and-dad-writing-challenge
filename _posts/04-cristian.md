I wake up at 10:30. I watch Ninjago. I play with the foot ball in the house. I eat cereal pillows with warm, but not too warm milk. I go to school, but just to play  football and nothing else, maybe something with my friends. I go to Microsoft Store and play some more football and then switch to Forza 4 and do some lanÄ‘scaping using an expensive sports car. I came back home where I play on my iPad and watch Ninjago on Netflix. Then I assemble a Ninjago Lego box.

I don't do typing, speaking on the phon with grandparents, homework or writing.
