Oh, so marvellous, this amazing matches sculpture... took me almost two months of painstaking trial and error, so beautiful and so majestic, and yet so fragile...

It is a box, and inside it Pandora who'll open a box. Pandora in a box, of matches. Only a match left, one and it's over! I filmed every move every match on top of the other match, in what I think will be the ultimate stop motion film, in what I think will be the height of my cha cha cha chew!!!

No more Pandora, the sneeze destroyed it.
