I am still searching for it, where does it come from?
What is it? Something spoiled? Something dead? Somebody worked all day in a swamp and then ran home with 40 degrees outside and left his socks inside for me to smell? What can it be?

It is the Muhammad Ali, the Mike Tyson of smells. It punched my nose, but from inside, just as I opened the door to the fridge. Repugnant, but interesting, it should cut my appetite, but the appetite is strong, and resilient. Motivates me to keep the door open and fights its way to the rest of the food. The urge for the snack is stronger. Stronger than the smelly shout of this blue cheese I left uncovered inside and takes its revolting revenge at whomever opens the damned door.

I covered it back. Danish Blue's back in the box. The smell dissipates slowly, it's here to stay for another couple of days. It will outlive the cheese itself. Because tomorrow morn', I shall have scrambled eggs an' Danish Blue.
