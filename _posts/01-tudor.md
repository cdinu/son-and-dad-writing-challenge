This cereal contains delicious pieces with honey that melts in your mouth. 

The outside has crispy  chocolate cracking deliciously in between your teath. 

The pillow also works with tea but it is highly recommended with milk as  it absorbs the pillow better. The crispy melty pillow is as delicious as your favourite desert.
