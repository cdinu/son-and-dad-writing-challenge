**Part 1**

Dear Neighbour Next-door,

I am writing to thank you for everything you do for me, even if we never got to talk.
You help me appreciate smells, you help me appreciate silence. You make me think of games, and parties, of friends who laugh out loud.

At the beginning it bothered me we never talked in real life, but now I understand that this is how things are supposed to be.

Sincerely yours,
X

**Part 2**

My neighbour smokes, the cigarette smell gets everywhere and I have to keep all the hallway doors open so that only a fraction gets in my house.  
He has a loud girlfriend who laughs so hard that it makes me think that some monkey from the zoo escaped and is fighting fiercely for a banana.  
He throws parties with loud music, action films and games.
I wrote him a message to meet, but he never replied.
