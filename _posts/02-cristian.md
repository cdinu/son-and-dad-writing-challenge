challenge: "Grandpa at a kindergarten"
points: 1

It is quite odd to take my grandpa to the kindergarten today. Oh, these experiments and their failures...

The liquid I gave him was to make him younger, to reverse his ageing process, but guess what. My grandpa really likes his drinks so he drank the whole bottle. Fortunately the bottle was not full, so now he's three and a half, instead of ninety three and a half.

He's so small that he cannot be safe in the house so the only place where we can keep him, at least until I get the ingredients for the antidote, is the nursery. It was quite hard to convince them to accept him. I had to forge some paperwork of my cousin, who is five.
