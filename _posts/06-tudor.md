I was sitting down when a abominable wave of sinky smell catched my nose. I walked to where the bad smell was comming from and I looked out the openwindow and saw my neighbour(with his window open too)opening a tin can. I gasped. He once told me that he had a tin can full of beans that had expired on the 2/4/1986. It was as stinky and tretorous as if I was surrounded by 50 garbage trucks in a junk yard. 
“What are you going with that?” I questioned him. 

“Ah,the right time has come. The date I was going to open it has come”,he said kindly. 

“Don’t you mind the smell?”

“Yes but I am enjoying the moment I have waited 34 years for”

“I guess,” I said.

I left and coughed.
