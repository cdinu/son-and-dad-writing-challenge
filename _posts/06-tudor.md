I was sitting down when an abominable wave of stinky smell caught my nose. I walked to where the bad smell was coming from; I looked out the open window and saw my neighbour (with his window open too) opening a tin can. I gasped. He once told me he had a tin can full of beans that had expired on the 2/4/1986.

It was as stinky and tretorous as if 50 garbage trucks surrounded me in a junkyard. 


“What are you doing with that?” I questioned him. 


“Ah, the right time has come. The date I would open it has come,” he said kindly. 


“Don’t you mind the smell?”


“Yes, but I am enjoying the moment I have waited 34 years for”


“I guess,” I said.


I left and coughed.
